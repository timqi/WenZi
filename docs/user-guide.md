## Level 1: Getting Started

**Goal:** Install 闻字 and transcribe your first sentence.

### Install

**Option A — Download Release (easiest):**

1. Download `WenZi.app` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Airead/WenZi/releases) page.
2. Drag it to `/Applications`.
3. Double-click to launch.

> **First launch:** macOS blocks unsigned apps. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, find the 闻字 blocked message, and click **Open Anyway**.

**Option B — Build from Source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Airead/WenZi
cd WenZi
uv sync
./scripts/build.sh        # builds WenZi.app in dist/
```

**Option C — Run from Source (for developers):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Airead/WenZi
cd WenZi
uv sync
uv run python -m wenzi
```

### Grant Permissions

On first launch, macOS will ask for:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| **Microphone** | Record your voice |
| **Accessibility** | Type text into other apps |
| **Speech Recognition** | Only needed for Apple Speech backend |

Grant all requested permissions in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

### First Launch: Ready Immediately

The default ASR backend is **Apple On-Device Speech** — it uses the built-in macOS speech recognizer, so **no model download is needed**. 闻字 is ready to transcribe right after granting permissions.

> **Note:** If you later switch to FunASR or MLX-Whisper in Settings, 闻字 will need to download a model (~75 MB to ~1.6 GB depending on the model). During download:
>
> - The menubar icon changes to a **download icon** (⬇) with a percentage like `DL 45%`
> - **Please wait for the download to complete** before trying to transcribe
> - Click menubar → **View Logs...** to open the built-in log viewer and monitor download progress in real time
> - Once loading finishes, the icon changes back to a **microphone icon** (🎙) and the status shows "Ready"
>
> **Tip:** If a download fails or is interrupted, delete the cache directory (`~/.cache/modelscope/` for FunASR, `~/.cache/huggingface/` for MLX-Whisper) and restart 闻字 to retry.

### Your First Transcription

1. Look for the **microphone icon** (🎙) in the menubar — that means 闻字 is ready.
2. Open any text input (Notes, browser, editor, terminal…).
3. **Hold** the `fn` key and speak.
4. **Release** `fn` — the transcribed text appears.

That's it! You've completed the basic workflow.

### Understanding the Menubar Icon

The menubar icon changes to reflect the current status:

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🎙 (mic.fill) | Ready | Idle, ready to record |
| 〰 (waveform) | Recording... | Capturing audio |
| 💬 (text.bubble) | Transcribing... | Processing speech to text |
| ✨ (sparkles) | Enhancing... | AI enhancement in progress |
| 👁 (eye) | Preview... | Preview panel is open |
| ⬇ (arrow.down.circle) + DL X% | Downloading... | Model download in progress |
| ⚙ (cpu) | Loading... | Loading model into memory |
| ⚠ (triangle) | Error | Something went wrong |

---

## Level 2: Daily Use Basics

**Goal:** Understand the two output modes and basic menubar controls.

### Preview Mode vs Direct Mode

闻字 has two ways to deliver results:

| Mode | Behavior | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Preview** (default) | Shows a floating panel — review and edit before confirming | When accuracy matters, or you want to check before typing |
| **Direct** | Types text immediately into the active app | When speed matters and you trust the transcription |

Toggle via: menubar → **Settings...** → General tab → **Preview** checkbox.

### Preview Panel Basics

When Preview is on, after recording you'll see a floating panel:

- **Confirm** (`Enter`) — types the text and closes the panel
- **Copy to clipboard** (`⌘+Enter`) — copies the text to clipboard instead of typing
- **Cancel** (`Esc`) — discards the text
- **Edit** — click the text area to modify before confirming

### Menubar Overview

Click the **microphone icon** in the menubar to see the menu:

```
🎙
├── Ready                    (status indicator)
├── ─────────────────────
├── Enhance Clipboard        AI-enhance selected text (Ctrl+Cmd+V)
├── Browse History...        Search and browse past transcriptions
├── Settings...              Open the settings panel (4 tabs)
├── ─────────────────────
├── View Logs...             Open log viewer
├── Usage Stats              View usage statistics
├── About 闻字          Version info
└── Quit
```

All model selection, AI enhancement configuration, and hotkey management are done through the **Settings** panel — not the menubar menu directly.

### Recording Feedback

While holding `fn`, a floating indicator with audio level bars shows you're recording. A sound plays on start and stop (configurable in Settings → General).

When the ASR backend supports streaming (e.g., Apple Speech), a **live transcription overlay** appears below the recording indicator, showing partial transcription text in real time as you speak. This gives you immediate visual feedback without waiting for the recording to end.

### Recording Controls

While holding the recording hotkey, you can press additional keys to control the session:

| Key (while holding `fn`) | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd` (default) | **Restart recording** — discards current audio and starts a new recording |
| `Space` (default) | **Cancel recording** — discards audio and returns to idle |
| `Z` | **Show last preview** — cancels recording and opens the last preview result |

The restart and cancel keys can be customized in Settings → General (or via config: `feedback.restart_key` and `feedback.cancel_key`).

---

## Level 3: Choosing the Right ASR Backend

**Goal:** Pick the best speech engine for your needs.

### Backend Comparison

| Backend | Language | Speed | Accuracy | Download Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Apple Speech** (default) | Multiple | Fast | Good | None (built-in) |
| **FunASR** | Chinese | Fast | High (Chinese) | ~500 MB |
| **MLX-Whisper** | 99 languages | Medium | High | 75 MB – 1.6 GB |
| **Whisper API** | Multiple | Depends on network | High | None (cloud) |

### How to Switch

Open **Settings...** → **STT** tab. You'll see:

- **Local** section: Radio buttons for all available local ASR presets (FunASR, MLX-Whisper variants, Apple Speech)
- **Remote** section: Cloud-based ASR providers you've configured

Click a radio button to switch. The model will start loading (or downloading if not yet cached).

> **First download reminder:** When switching to a new MLX-Whisper model for the first time, the model needs to download. Watch the menubar icon for `DL X%` progress. Model sizes range from ~75 MB (tiny) to ~1.6 GB (large-v3-turbo).

### Recommendations

- **Zero-setup, any language** → Apple Speech (default — no download, supports real-time streaming)
- **Chinese only** → FunASR (best accuracy for Chinese, fully offline)
- **English or multilingual, high accuracy** → MLX-Whisper small or large-v3-turbo
- **Best accuracy, don't mind latency** → Whisper API via Groq (free tier available)

---

## Level 4: AI Enhancement

**Goal:** Use an LLM to proofread, translate, or reformat transcribed text.

AI enhancement is **optional** — by default it's off. When enabled, your transcribed text is sent to an LLM for post-processing before output.

### Step 1: Set Up an LLM Provider

You need an LLM backend. Two easy options:

**Option A — Local with Ollama (free, private):**

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) and run `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`
2. That's it — 闻字.s default config points to Ollama

**Option B — Cloud API (e.g., DeepSeek, OpenAI):**

1. Open **Settings...** → **LLM** tab → **Add Provider...**
2. Fill in provider details:
   ```
   name: deepseek
   base_url: https://api.deepseek.com/v1
   api_key: sk-your-key
   models:
     deepseek-chat
   ```
3. Click **Verify** → **Save**

### Step 2: Select an Enhancement Mode

Open **Settings...** → **AI** tab. Select a mode:

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Off** | No enhancement (raw transcription) |
| **纠错润色** (Proofread) | Fix typos, grammar, punctuation |
| **翻译为英文** (Translate EN) | Translate to English |
| **命令行大神** (Commandline) | Convert speech to shell commands |

### Step 3: Try It

1. Make sure an LLM provider is configured and a mode is selected.
2. Hold `fn`, say something, release.
3. The result now goes through the LLM before appearing.

> **Tip:** Start with "纠错润色" (Proofread) — it's the most universally useful mode.

---

## Level 5: Preview Power Features

**Goal:** Master the preview panel's editing and switching capabilities.

With Preview mode on and AI enhancement active, the preview panel becomes a powerful editor.

### Quick Mode Switching

Press `⌘1` through `⌘9` to instantly switch enhancement modes and re-process the same audio:

- `⌘1` = first mode in list (e.g., Proofread)
- `⌘2` = second mode (e.g., Translate EN)
- `⌘3` = third mode (e.g., Commandline)
- …and so on for custom modes

### Result Caching

When you switch modes in the preview panel, 闻字 **caches** completed results. Switching back to a previously used mode shows the cached result instantly (marked `[cached]`) — no API call needed.

The cache is cleared when new audio is recorded.

### Preview History

闻字 keeps an **in-memory history** of your last 10 preview results (cleared on app restart). This lets you go back to a previous transcription without re-recording.

- **History dropdown:** Click the clock icon in the preview panel's toolbar to open a dropdown showing recent previews. Select one to reload it into the panel.
- **Quick recall:** Press `fn+Z` at any time (even outside the preview panel) to cancel any active recording and instantly open the most recent preview result.

### Web Preview Panel

The preview panel uses a modern **WKWebView-based** (HTML/CSS/JS) interface by default, providing a polished look with dark mode support. You can switch between the web-based and native AppKit preview in Settings → General → **Web Preview** toggle.

### Other Preview Features

| Feature | How |
|---|---|
| **Edit text** | Click the text area and type |
| **Copy to clipboard** | `⌘+Enter` — copies instead of typing into the active app |
| **Toggle punctuation** | Check/uncheck the **Punc** checkbox to re-transcribe with/without punctuation |
| **Switch STT model** | Use the STT dropdown in the panel |
| **Switch LLM model** | Use the LLM dropdown in the panel |
| **Play audio** | Click the play button to hear the recording |
| **Save audio** | Click save to export the recording as a file |
| **Google Translate** | Click the translate button to open Google Translate with current text |

---

## Level 6: Direct Mode & Streaming

**Goal:** Use 闻字 for fast, hands-free input with real-time AI feedback.

### Enable Direct Mode

Turn off Preview: **Settings...** → General tab → uncheck **Preview**.

Now when you release the hotkey, text is typed directly into the active app — no panel, no confirmation needed.

### Real-Time Streaming STT

When using an ASR backend that supports streaming (currently Apple Speech), 闻字 shows a **live transcription overlay** during recording. Partial text appears in real-time as you speak, giving you instant feedback before you even release the hotkey.

This works in both Preview and Direct modes. In Direct mode, it is especially useful because you can see the transcription forming and decide whether to keep or cancel it.

### AI Streaming Overlay

In direct mode, after recording ends, a **streaming overlay** appears showing the processing pipeline:

1. **Transcription phase** — the overlay first shows the ASR result (or streams partial text if the backend supports it)
2. **Enhancement phase** (if AI enhancement is active) — the LLM processes the text in real-time, with tokens appearing as they are generated

Controls during the overlay:

- Press **Esc** to cancel transcription/enhancement and discard the result
- The overlay shows token count and processing status
- Once complete, the final text is typed automatically

### When to Use Direct Mode

- Chat apps where speed matters
- Terminal / command line input
- Any workflow where you trust the AI output and don't need to review

---

## Level 7: Clipboard Enhancement

**Goal:** AI-enhance any text in any app, not just speech transcriptions.

### How It Works

1. **Select** text in any application.
2. Press `Ctrl+Cmd+V` (default hotkey).
3. 闻字 copies the selection, sends it to the LLM with the current enhancement mode, and outputs the result.

You can also trigger it from the menubar: click **Enhance Clipboard**.

### Use Cases

- Select a rough draft → enhance with Proofread mode
- Select Chinese text → translate to English
- Select a task description → convert to shell command

### Output Behavior

- **Preview on:** Result appears in the preview panel for review
- **Preview off:** Result replaces via clipboard

### Customize the Hotkey

Edit `~/.config/WenZi/config.json`:

```json
{
  "clipboard_enhance": {
    "hotkey": "ctrl+cmd+v"
  }
}
```

The hotkey format is `modifier+modifier+key`. See [Level 12](#hotkey-configuration) for format details and examples.

---

## Level 8: Custom Enhancement Modes

**Goal:** Create your own AI modes and chain pipelines.

### Create a Custom Mode

**Via Settings (easy):**

1. Open **Settings...** → **AI** tab → **Add Mode...**
2. Edit the template, click **Save**, enter a mode ID.

**Via file (flexible):**

Create a `.md` file in `~/.config/WenZi/enhance_modes/`:

```markdown
---
label: Formal Email
order: 60
---
You are a professional email writing assistant.
Rewrite the user's input as a formal, polished email body.
Use appropriate greetings and closings if context suggests an email.
Maintain the original intent and key information.
Output only the email text without any explanation.
```

The filename (without `.md`) becomes the mode ID. Restart to load.

### Create a Chain Mode

Chain modes run multiple steps sequentially:

```markdown
---
label: 润色+翻译EN
order: 25
steps: proofread, translate_en
---
First proofreads the text, then translates to English.
(This body is documentation only — each step uses its own prompt.)
```

### Tips for Good Prompts

- Be specific about what to do AND what NOT to do
- End with "Output only the processed text without any explanation"
- Use `order` values with gaps (10, 20, 30…) so you can insert modes between them

See [Enhancement Mode Examples](enhance-mode-examples.md) for ready-to-use templates covering email, meeting notes, translation, developer tools, and more.

---

## Level 9: Multi-Provider Setup

**Goal:** Configure multiple ASR and LLM providers and switch between them.

### Why Multiple Providers?

- Use a fast local model (Ollama) for simple tasks, cloud API for complex ones
- Have a backup when one provider is down
- Compare results across different models

### Add Providers via Settings

**LLM providers:** Settings → **LLM** tab → **Add Provider...**

**ASR providers:** Settings → **STT** tab → **Add Provider...**

Both use the same dialog format:

```
name: provider-name
base_url: https://api.example.com/v1
api_key: your-key
models:
  model-1
  model-2
```

### Switch at Runtime

In the **Settings** panel, all configured models appear as radio buttons. Click to switch — no restart needed.

### In Preview Panel

You can also switch LLM and STT models directly from the preview panel's dropdowns, making it easy to compare results from different models on the same audio.

See [Provider & Model Setup Guide](provider-model-guide.md) for detailed examples covering Ollama, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, Qwen, and more.

---

## Level 10: Vocabulary & Conversation History

**Goal:** Teach 闻字 your personal terms and maintain topic context across turns.

### Vocabulary Retrieval

**Problem:** ASR often misrecognizes proper nouns, technical terms, and names (e.g., "萍萍" → "平平").

**Solution:** 闻字 builds a personal vocabulary from your correction history and uses it to improve future results.

#### How to Build Vocabulary

1. **Use Preview mode with AI enhancement** — edit the result when the AI gets a term wrong.
2. Each edit is logged to `~/.config/WenZi/conversation_history.jsonl` with a `user_corrected` flag.
3. **Auto build** (default): After every 10 corrections, vocabulary is rebuilt automatically in the background.
4. **Manual build:** Settings → **AI** tab → **Build Vocabulary...**

#### Enable Vocabulary

Settings → **AI** tab → toggle **Vocabulary (N)**. The number shows how many entries are indexed.

When enabled, relevant vocabulary entries are retrieved via embedding similarity and injected into the LLM prompt, helping it correct domain-specific terms.

### Conversation History

**Problem:** Each transcription is independent — the LLM doesn't know what you just said.

**Solution:** 闻字 injects recent confirmed outputs into the AI prompt, so the LLM understands the current topic.

#### Enable

Settings → **AI** tab → toggle **Conversation History**.

#### How It Works

- Only **preview-confirmed** records are used (ensuring quality)
- Recent entries are formatted efficiently with arrow notation for corrections
- The LLM uses this context to maintain consistency (e.g., always using the correct name spelling)

#### Browse History

Menubar → **Browse History...** opens a full-featured history browser with:

- **Text search** — search across all transcription text fields
- **Tag filters** — click tag pills to filter by enhance mode (proofread, translate, etc.), STT model, LLM model, or whether corrections were made
- **Time range filtering** — filter by today, last 7 days, last 30 days, or all time
- **Record deletion** — select a record and click Delete to remove it
- **Edit and save** — modify the final text of any record and save changes
- **Archived records** — check the "Archived" toggle to include records from monthly archives

#### Auto-Rotation and Archiving

When conversation history exceeds **20,000 records**, 闻字 automatically archives older records into monthly files under `~/.config/WenZi/conversation_history_archives/YYYY-MM.jsonl`. The main history file keeps the most recent 20,000 records for fast access, while archived records remain searchable through the history browser.

See [Conversation History Enhancement](conversation-history-enhancement.md) for technical details.

---

## Level 11: Launcher

**Goal:** Use the built-in Launcher for quick access to apps, files, clipboard, bookmarks, and snippets.

The Launcher is a keyboard-driven search panel built into 闻字's scripting system. It works like Alfred or Raycast — press a hotkey, type to search, and press Enter to act.

### Enable the Launcher

1. Enable scripting: **Settings...** → General tab → **Scripting** toggle
2. Edit `~/.config/WenZi/config.json` and set:

```json
{
  "scripting": {
    "chooser": {
      "enabled": true,
      "hotkey": "cmd+space"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart 闻字.

### Basic Usage

1. Press `Cmd+Space` (or your configured hotkey) to open the Launcher.
2. Start typing to search apps — results appear instantly.
3. Press `Enter` to open the selected app, or `⌘+Enter` to reveal it in Finder.
4. Press `Esc` to close.

### Prefix Search

Use a prefix followed by a space to search a specific source:

| Type this | To search |
|-----------|-----------|
| `f readme` | Files named "readme" |
| `cb hello` | Clipboard entries containing "hello" |
| `bm github` | Bookmarks matching "github" |
| `sn email` | Snippets matching "email" |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `↑` `↓` | Navigate results |
| `Enter` | Open / execute |
| `⌘+Enter` | Reveal in Finder |
| `⌘1` – `⌘9` | Quick select by position |
| `Esc` | Close |

### Extending with Scripts

You can add custom data sources to the Launcher via scripts. See [Scripting Documentation](scripting.md) for the `wz.chooser.source` API.

---

## Level 12: Fine-Tuning & Troubleshooting

**Goal:** Optimize your setup and solve common problems.

### Settings Panel

Menubar → **Settings...** opens a panel with 4 tabs:

| Tab | What you can configure |
|---|---|
| **General** | Recording hotkeys, sound feedback, visual indicator, preview toggle, web/native preview, restart/cancel key selection, scripting toggle, custom config directory |
| **STT** | Local ASR model selection, remote ASR provider management |
| **LLM** | LLM provider and model selection, provider management |
| **AI** | Enhancement mode (displayed in defined order, not alphabetical), thinking mode, vocabulary, conversation history, auto build |

The Settings panel **remembers the last active tab** across sessions. At the bottom, toolbar buttons provide quick access to **Show Config**, **Edit Config**, and **Reload Config**.

#### Custom Config Directory

In the General tab, you can set a **custom config directory** to store 闻字 configuration files in a location of your choice (e.g., a synced folder). After changing the directory, 闻字 will prompt you to restart for the change to take effect.

#### Scripting Toggle

The General tab includes a **Scripting** toggle to enable or disable the scripting/plugin system. When enabled, 闻字 loads and executes Python scripts from the configured script directory. See the [Scripting Documentation](scripting.md) for details on writing plugins.

### Hotkey Configuration

闻字 supports flexible hotkey configuration. The recording hotkey is configured in the **Settings** panel (General tab), while the clipboard enhance hotkey is set in the config file.

#### Hotkey Format

Hotkeys use the format `modifier+modifier+key`, where:

- **Modifiers:** `cmd` (or `command`), `ctrl`, `alt` (or `option`), `shift`
- **Regular keys:** `a`–`z`, `0`–`9`
- **Special keys:** `fn`, `f1`–`f12`, `esc`, `space`
- **Right-side modifiers:** `cmd_r`, `ctrl_r`, `alt_r`, `shift_r`

#### Examples

| Hotkey | Config value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Fn key (hold to record) | `"fn"` | Default recording hotkey — single special key |
| F5 key | `"f5"` | Use a function key to record |
| Ctrl+Cmd+V | `"ctrl+cmd+v"` | Default clipboard enhance hotkey |
| Shift+Cmd+Space | `"shift+cmd+space"` | Alternative with Space key |
| Alt+D | `"alt+d"` | Option+D combination |
| Ctrl+Shift+R | `"ctrl+shift+r"` | Triple modifier example |
| Ctrl+Cmd+1 | `"ctrl+cmd+1"` | Number key combination |

#### Config File Examples

```json
{
  "hotkeys": {
    "fn": true,
    "f5": true
  },
  "clipboard_enhance": {
    "hotkey": "shift+cmd+space"
  }
}
```

Multiple recording hotkeys can be enabled simultaneously by adding entries to the `hotkeys` map with `true` values. Set to `false` to disable a hotkey without removing it.

### Configuration File

Default location: `~/.config/WenZi/config.json`

The config directory can be changed to a custom path via Settings → General → Config Directory (stored in macOS preferences, survives config file changes).

You only need to include fields you want to change — everything else uses defaults. After editing, click **Reload Config** in the Settings toolbar to apply without restarting.

See [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for all options.

### Logging

Logs are saved to `~/Library/Logs/WenZi/wenzi.log` (5 MB rotation, 3 backups).

**View logs (recommended):** Menubar → **View Logs...** opens the built-in log viewer — the easiest way to check logs, monitor model download/loading progress, and diagnose issues in real time.

Log files are also available on disk at the path above if you prefer an external editor.

### Usage Statistics

Menubar → **Usage Stats** opens an interactive statistics dashboard with:

- **Summary cards** — total transcriptions (with today's count), total tokens consumed (with cached input token breakdown), accept rate, and total recording time
- **Interactive charts** (powered by Chart.js) with selectable time ranges (7/14/30 days):
  - **Daily Transcriptions** — stacked bar chart showing Direct vs Preview mode usage per day
  - **User Actions** — stacked bar chart of Accept / Modified / Cancel actions per day
  - **Token Usage** — stacked bar chart of Prompt / Completion / Cached tokens per day
  - **Enhance Modes** — stacked bar chart showing usage of each enhancement mode per day

### Common Issues

#### Text doesn't type into the app
- Check **Accessibility** permission in System Settings
- Try switching output method in config: `"output": {"method": "clipboard"}`

#### Model download takes too long
- The menubar shows `DL X%` during download — this is normal when switching to a model for the first time
- FunASR: ~500 MB, MLX-Whisper large-v3-turbo: ~1.6 GB
- Check the log viewer for detailed progress
- If partially downloaded, delete the cache directory (`~/.cache/modelscope/` for FunASR, `~/.cache/huggingface/` for MLX-Whisper) and restart

#### LLM enhancement times out
- Increase timeout: edit `config.json` → `ai_enhance.timeout` (default: 30s)
- Check if your LLM provider is reachable
- For Ollama, ensure it's running: `ollama serve`

#### Preview panel doesn't appear
- Make sure **Preview** is enabled in Settings → General
- Try clicking the menubar icon to bring the app to focus

#### Notifications don't work during development
- Expected when running via `uv run` without app bundling
- Notifications work normally in the packaged `.app` version

### Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Shortcut | Context | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `fn` (hold/release) | Global | Record / stop and transcribe |
| `fn` + `Cmd` | During recording | Restart recording (discard current audio, start new) |
| `fn` + `Space` | During recording | Cancel recording (discard audio, return to idle) |
| `fn` + `Z` | During recording | Cancel recording and show last preview history |
| `Ctrl+Cmd+V` | Global | Clipboard enhancement |
| `Cmd+Space` | Global | Open/close Launcher (if enabled) |
| `Enter` | Preview panel | Confirm and type text |
| `⌘+Enter` | Preview panel | Copy to clipboard |
| `Esc` | Preview panel / Streaming overlay | Cancel |
| `⌘1` – `⌘9` | Preview panel | Switch enhancement mode |
| `⌘A/C/V/X` | Preview panel | Standard edit shortcuts |
| `⌘Z` / `⌘⇧Z` | Preview panel | Undo / Redo |

> **Note:** The restart key (`Cmd`) and cancel key (`Space`) are configurable in Settings → General or via config (`feedback.restart_key` and `feedback.cancel_key`). Available choices: `cmd`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, `space`, `esc`.

## What's Next?

You now know everything 闻字 offers. Here are some ideas to get the most out of it:

- **Create modes for your workflow** — meeting notes, code review comments, Slack messages
- **Build chain modes** — proofread → translate, or summarize → format
- **Accumulate vocabulary** — the more you correct, the smarter it gets
- **Try different models** — compare Groq's speed vs local Ollama's privacy vs OpenAI's accuracy
- **Write scripts** — extend 闻字 with Python scripts for custom hotkey actions (see [Scripting Documentation](scripting.md))
- **Browse [Enhancement Mode Examples](enhance-mode-examples.md)** for inspiration

For technical details on any feature, see the [documentation index](../README.md#documentation).
